# Introduction

This is a book powered by [GitBook](https://louisazhou.gitbook.io/notes/), documenting my study notes and some thoughts studying ML/Statistics/Python.

Some of the chapters are relatively well-written, as I was reviewing them I did a bit of polishing, but there are some that are for note-taking purpose or documenting purposes only. If you are using this as your reference, please use it cautiously.
