The following chapters are written in English because I was expecting such audience: 

## Course Projects \(Big Data, Social Network, and Machine Learning\)

As for the rest of the chapters, some are relatively well-written, because I did a bit of polishing when reviewing the materials, but they are mostly for note-taking purpose or documenting purposes only.
