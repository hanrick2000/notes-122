# Supply Chain

## 挑战

丝绸之路就是最早的supply chain，从中国运丝绸和茶叶，从欧洲运香料。而现在的supply chain复杂度更高。

现在Supply Chain的挑战：Faster, more flexible, more granular, and more efficient 

1. Rising Customer Expectations: - Real Time Tracking  - Precise Inventory Management  - Wide range of product availability  - High availability, reliable lead times, transparency  
2.  Fast Fulfillment and Large Volume of Orders - Fast-paced timeline of ordering \(overnight shipping for holiday\) - Quick growth of parcel and less-than-truckload shipment  
3. Uniqueness and Large Variation of Order - Special requirement of configuration, urgency and delivery locations - Ad hoc and real time planning \(last minute change, change typo, etc.\)  
4. Leader and Management Team requires 360 degree visibility  - Leaders orchestrate demand and supply, information from different channels  - End-to-End transparency throughout the supply chain  
5. Accelerating Scale, Scope and Depth of Data  - Utilize such immense data sets to drive contextual intelligence  - Enable more complex supplier networks that focus on knowledge sharing and collaboration instead of just completing transactions is critical
