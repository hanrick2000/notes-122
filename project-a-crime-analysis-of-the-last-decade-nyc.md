# Project: A Crime Analysis of the Last Decade NYC

The followings are slides & written report for the Big Data Seminar course. It is a project written with Spark, deployed first on DataBricks and then on Amazon EMR. The packages involved: SparkML developed by Apache Spark team, and Azure Machine Learning developed by Microsoft.  

I used the community version DataBricks, and the EMR costed around $5 \(paid by school\). If you are interested in replicating the result yourself, feel free to take my code from the following links:
