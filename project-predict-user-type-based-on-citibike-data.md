# Project: Predict User Type Based on Citibike Data

This was a project done about 9 months ago, in April, 2019. 

Back then, I submitted the same project for two courses, one is an individual project, using KNN and C4.5 for classification on user type \(subscriber/customer\). Then I used the same code for data-preprocessing on a team project, with the same topic, and with my team members. We included Naive Bayes and PCA in the analysis.  

The slide was submitted during the individual project \(KNN & C4.5\), while the report was written for the group project \(with Naive Bayes, PCA, Logistic Regression included\).
